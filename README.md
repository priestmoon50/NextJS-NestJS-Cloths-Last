# E-commerce Website

This is a full-stack e-commerce website built entirely by me from scratch, using **Next.js**, **Nest.js**, **MongoDB**, and **TypeScript**. The project showcases my ability to handle both frontend and backend development, including designing, implementing, and optimizing the entire system.

## Key Features:
- **Frontend:** Built with Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR) and improved performance.
- **Backend:** Powered by Nest.js, providing a robust and scalable API structure.
- **Database:** Uses MongoDB for efficient data storage and management.
- **TypeScript:** The entire project is written in TypeScript for better type safety and maintainability.

## Use Case:
This e-commerce platform is designed to be flexible and scalable, and it can be used for selling any kind of products. I am continuously improving the platform by adding new features and optimizing performance.

Feel free to check out the code, explore the project, and provide any feedback!

### Ongoing Development:
I am actively working on enhancing this project with new features and improvements to make it more efficient and user-friendly.
